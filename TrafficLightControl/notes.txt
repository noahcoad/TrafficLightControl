Improvement Ideas
	make X10 controller parameters configurable (path to .exe and script files)
	show the current state of the light in the UI
		should it be an option?
		what would it look like, the system tray icon changing?
	show the context menu on regular left-click (instead of just right-click)
	inform the user on first launch where to make setting changes
	post on github
	blog post about it
		red = be quite and don't disturb, Daddy's on an important phone call
		yellow = you can come in to give Daddy a hug
		green = play time! Daddy is off work
